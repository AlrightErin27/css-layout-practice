# CSS Layout Practice using Flexbox and Grid

In this assignment, you're going to use your formidable CSS skills to mock up the layouts in each layout folder. They would be pretty difficult to achieve without our new Flexbox and Grid knowledge so please use those primarily for your solutions.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Each folder has some starter HTML and an image of artwork that you must replicate using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Requirements

* Look at the image (a composite by Piet Mondrian).
* You must replicate the structure of the composite using HTML and CSS.
* Do your best to match the colors in the boxes where applicable.
* Note the thickness of the border lines and match that as closely as possible.

## Deliverable

A working HTML and CSS solution that matches the layout in the art image.

## Bonuses

* Style the todo list with your own *beautiful* sense of design.
* Use [jquery-ui sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/) to make the todo list sortable. We'll be going over this more in the context of jQuery plugins
* Use the built-in HTML5 feature of local storage. Store your todo item into local storage. When your page is refreshed it will load the old todo items from localstorage.
